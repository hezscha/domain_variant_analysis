there is a conserved W at pHMM state 32, which is MSA col 37 (look at /storage1/hezscha/genome_proteome_map/results/domain_analysis/SH3_1/pfam_aln/PF00018_seed.hmm and consult the about pfam card)
now I need to find out which pos that is in my combine aln (seed + human proteome)

>pfam seed: /storage1/hezscha/genome_proteome_map/results/domain_analysis/SH3_1/pfam_aln/PF00018_seed.hmm
>VAV_HUMAN/788-834

                                  this W is pos 37
